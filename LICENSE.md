# VEN Symbolic Infrastructure License (VSIL) v1.1

**Effective Date:** July 2, 2025  
**Author:** Wolf Mind Trust LLC  
**Applies to:** All files, symbolic architectures, metadata, narrative structures, assertion mappings, and integrity manifests under the `ledger-of-collapse` repository and its submodules.

---

## 1. Purpose

This license governs the use, distribution, and reproduction of symbolic infrastructure and derived assets under the **Veritas Externalization Network (VEN)** and **Veritas Substrate Architecture**. It is intended to protect institutional modeling patterns, contradiction mapping techniques, evidentiary substrate blueprints, and symbolic expression protocols from unauthorized use while enabling controlled reuse under contractual terms.

---

## 2. Covered Intellectual Property

This license covers all intellectual property developed within and derived from the Ledger-of-Collapse framework, including symbolic, structural, evidentiary, and software artifacts. The scope includes:

- **Symbolic Node Infrastructure**  
  All symbolic node deployments and architectural directory structures (e.g., `ark/<entity>/`, `collapse_blocks/`, `filings/`, `substrate/`) instantiated in alignment with the Veritas Epistemic Network (VEN).

- **Schema and Metadata Files**  
  Canonical structured files including but not limited to:  
  `symbolic_scope.md`, `symbolic_assertions.yaml`, `contradiction_trace.yaml`,  
  `ven_inf.md`, `veritas_manifest.yaml`, `node_identity.yaml`,  
  `ven_registry.yaml`, `collapse_registry.yaml`, and all derived assertion schemas and registry maps.

- **Collapse Encoding Architectures**  
  - All logical encodings of contradiction (e.g., `T → R` mappings).
  - Formal and symbolic representations of institutional collapse.
  - Archetypal and mimetic encodings expressed through trinary or quaternary Ark schemata.

- **Tooling and Generation Scripts**  
  Includes but is not limited to:  
  `make_manifest_html.py`, `gen_sha_manifest.py`,  
  `generate_assertion_map.py`, `mk_metadata_appendix.py`,  
  and associated Makefile orchestration pipelines used to automate reproducible symbolic and evidentiary outputs.

- **Template and Archetype Documents**  
  All public-facing or internal-facing archetypal documents generated via VEN doctrine, such as:  
  `veritas_substrate_architecture.md`, `Archivist_Trinary_Ark.md`,  
  and other system-anchored or persona-authored constructs.

- **Substrate-Bound Evidence**  
  SHA-anchored artifacts (screenshots, annotated documents, PDFs, logs, forensic files) stored under `substrate/`,  
  when referenced by assertions or collapse blocks and included in public node releases.

- **Mimetic and Narrative Constructs**  
  Symbolic diagrams, archetypal mappings (e.g., Möbius strip, Kali motif), sovereignty/enmeshment models, and  
  cognitive-state representations embedded in documentation or epistemic logic across VEN nodes.

- **Pipeline Logic and Epistemic Structures**  
  - Assertion integrity systems, symbolic ledger mappings, and contradiction chaining logic.
  - Any compositions or pipelines designed to maintain evidentiary traceability, epistemic consistency, or symbolic reproducibility across VEN deployments.
