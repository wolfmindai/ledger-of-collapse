──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This repository contains symbolic modeling infrastructure and evidentiary
architectures maintained under the **Veritas Externalization Network (VEN)**,
a framework designed to track and model institutional collapse, epistemic
failure, and transformation dynamics.

All files, metadata schemas, contradiction mappings, drop manifests, and
substrate scaffolds are protected under the **Veritas Symbolic Infrastructure
License (VSIL) v1.1**.

Covered elements include, but are not limited to:

- **The Ledger of Collapse (LOC)** — symbolic collapse modeling architecture
- **The ark/** and its **chronicles** — symbolic collapse modeling architecture, including agent modules and submodule registries that capture collapse dynamics, escalation patterns, and institutional disruption
- **T → R** contradiction maps and formal assertion structures for evidentiary integrity
- **GPG-bound and SHA-tracked evidentiary anchors** ensuring immutable, verifiable record-keeping
- Drop metadata, node manifests, and substrate integrity registries that ensure full traceability and reproducibility
- Archetypal encodings and **epistemic collapse indexing frameworks** used for mapping institutional failure and remediation paths

By accessing this repository, you agree to abide by the terms of the **VSIL v1.1**, which governs the use, modification, and redistribution of the materials herein. Unauthorized use of the materials, or modification of the symbolic infrastructure without compliance with the license, is prohibited.
